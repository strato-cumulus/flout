# flout - an exercise in concurrent processing of streaming data

Flout is a toy project with a goal of producing a distributed streaming tool that works in a similar way to [Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink).

While this project is inspired by the way Flink works, these two are unrelated. Furthermore, this project has no professional aspirations;
it's simply a way for me to get hands-on with C, POSIX and networking.

## Building

Simply put:

```make```

I've only tested this on my local machine running Debian 12 on x86_64.
